Hi, I'm Eric - Geostatistician & Python Developer.

I started my career as Geologist in the in mining and exploration field. After a bit of numerical modeling and light introduction to Python I continued my studies at the University of Alberta's [Centre for Computational Geostatistics (CCG)](http://www.ccgalberta.com/). My own research with Dr. Clayton Deutsch was focused on [Prediction of Local Uncertainty and Localization](https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/cef02516-1d3f-438d-b5e4-613706dc0de4).

My interest and experience in Python started with utilitarian scripts to string together a few FORTRAN programs. Since then I've gained an appreciation for Python and programming in a broader context - Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Reproducible/Shareable Workflows in Jupyter Notebooks and just a touch of Web Dev.
