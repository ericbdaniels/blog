# Why? 
In the last few years I've slowly started a list of things that were interesting, challenging or particularly useful that I've encountered working with python. The mental list turned into a written list and now a blog for a few reasons.
1. Its an opportunity to write down some of these tid-bits so I don't forget them and have a reference next time something similar comes up.
2. Fastpages looked like a fun low barrier to entry blogging platform that makes it easy to share some code from a notebook, markdown or even a word file.
3. self-promotion. I'm generally terrible at this but every time I sign up for something new they ask for a github profile or personal website. If you've seen my github profile it needs some work... so here we are. 

## Does the world need another python blog?
Maybe, but probably not.

There are a lot great resources out there for learning python. Even so, I decided to start my own little page on the internet to share a few of the things I've learned and what I'm working on.
I can't promise code shared here will be absolutely perfect, but maybe it will be interesting and hopefully it will save you some time if you're working on something similar.

## Geoscience

My academic and professional background is in the geosciences (Geostatistics and Geology) and over the last 10 years I've found Python to be an amazing  [nearly] do it all tool to automate and improve day to day tasks. My interests in geoscience focused on (but not limited to) subsurface modeling. In most cases this implies some knowledge and a limited amount of data from subsurface and building models to predict whats going in the areas without existing data. 

## Python

I'm not sure where I heard it, but I was once told "Python is the second best language for everything", and I think thats true. In many cases there is another tool that might be better suited for a single specific task but as soon as you are connecting a few specific tasks into a larger workflow python outshines the other options as the best tool for the job. Python comes with drawbacks, out of the box it isn't the fastest language out there but its fun to write, easy to read and has a rapidly growing set of tools for almost anything you can think of.

## Goals
My goal is to add a post at least every few weeks. I don't really want to get into the weeds on Geostatistics (but if thats of interest let me know!), I'd rather share some small ah ha moments and lessons learned the hard way using python. Hopefully these snippets will be useful to others outside of my own little niche in the geoscience world as well.
